# Coding Patterns

These coding patterns will help you solve Leetcode problems effectively. These programs are written in Python.

| Coding Pattern                | Problem Format                            | Code Snippet                                  |
| :---                          |     :---:                                 |          ---:                                 |
|   Sliding Window(fixed size K)                
|   Input: Continuous Subarray with K elements in a list of N elements
    Approach: Slide a window of size K along the list
    Time: `O(N)`
    Brute Force: `O(N*K)
|   Max Sum of subarray
